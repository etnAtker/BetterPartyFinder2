  Filter the party finder better. Modified by etnAtker.

  All vanilla filtering is available, plus:

  - Create filter presets to easily switch between
  - Whitelist/blacklist specific duties and categories
  - Add character names to hide PFs from
  - Remove PFs above maximum item level
  - Filter on item level range
  - Filter on multiple jobs and slots (ex. MCH + GNB available)

  etnAtker modifies:

  - Add a checkbox to force one player per job, even if the party leader didn't set it.
  - Add a blacklist to hide parties by jobs you set.
